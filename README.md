# Analysis-on-Labour Force Participation Rates in India

The Labour Force Participation Rate is frequently used in conjunction with the Employment Rate as one of the most popular and relevant indicators of the health of a nation's labour market. The indicator captures the interaction of many variables, including the influence of how economic policies affect the level of employment, how widely the existing labour policies help few groups obtain employment for example, family-friendly policies for those with young kids(CEDEFOP, 2020). The Labour Force Participation Rate thus offers crucial information regarding the functioning of job markets across the nation and how they are impacted by various circumstances and events. From an already low 47% in 2016, India's labour force participation rate (LFPR) has dropped to barely 40%. This shows that approximately more than 50 percent of India's working-age population (15 years and older) chooses to stay out of the labour force and this percentage is rising.
